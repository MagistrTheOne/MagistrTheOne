## 🧑‍💻 Who Am I
I'm a **Fullstack Developer** with a background in **QA engineering**, a passion for **AI integration**, and a side-career in **music production**. I build entire products from UI to backend, deploy fast, and prioritize real-world usability over theoretical perfection.
I specialize in fast prototyping, clean architecture, and pushing projects into production that actually get used.
